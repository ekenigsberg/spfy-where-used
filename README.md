# spfy-where-used

*Q: "How do I run 'Where Is this Used?' on all custom fields at once?"*

*A:* Jupyter notebook *[spfy-where-used|https://github.com/ekenigsberg/spfy-where-used]*!

spfy-where-used leverages the "Simple Salesforce" Python library and Tooling API calls to generate a spreadsheet of all custom fields' "Where Is this Used?" results.

Sadly, "Where Is this Used?" doesn't cover Workflow or Data Validation. :-|
